# TCP-Chat
This is a fully-functioning TCP chat where will have one server that hosts the chat and multiple clients that connect to it and communicate with each other.
This is completely based on client-server architecture.

We will have to run the server first, so that there is a chat, which the clients can connect to. The clients themselves, are not going to directly communicate to each other but via the central server.
